The website provides users with information about artists and their songs and albums, and also, with access to their songs via streaming. Users can generate playlists and make these available to other users, they can like artists, give ratings (say, from one to five stars) to songs, and follow other users. We assume that all users who want to use the service have to sign up, choose a unique user name, and provide some basic information such as their name, email, and city. Some of this information may later be displayed on a profile page for each user. And for this project I did not realized the payment part, so every user once logged in can use this website freely. The whole project is ran on local server, implemented by MAMP software.
